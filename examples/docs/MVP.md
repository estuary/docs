This is intended to be a brief outline of what we'd specifically do in a MVP of docs in Estuary.

# MVP for Docs  

For our MVP, we'll release a subset of content of the files in the docs directory here.

1. Collections
    * The collections as it exists with the exception of file sizes and Date Added which would require much more work.
2. Collection
    * The collection file likely without the complex graph filtering that would require building many static pages to actually implement.  
    * Also references to file size / date added can be saved to a later version.

## Post MVP

After our initial MVP, the Endpoints and then transforms sections will likely make sense to implement.
