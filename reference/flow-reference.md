# Flow reference

The reference section goes beyond the [conceptual documentation](../concepts/high-level-concepts.md) to help engineers implement and customize data flows. It assumes you're familiar with the basic concepts.&#x20;

The following pages detail the structure of Flow entities and how they are set up and deployed, with accompanying code samples. It is not intended to be comprehensive; rather, it explains the most important elements in an easy-to-read format.&#x20;

The most complete and up-to-date information for entity structure can be found by running the command `flowctl json schema`, and the use of each command can be found with the --help option, for example, `flowctl discover --help` or `flowctl discover -h`.
