# Flow documentation

Estuary Flow is a tool for building, testing, and evolving pipelines that continuously capture, transform, and materialize data across all of your systems. It unifies today's batch and streaming paradigms so that your systems – current and future – are synchronized around the same data sets, updating in milliseconds.

Flow doesn’t replace your other systems; instead, it consolidates and simplifies your infrastructure. It does so with a powerful runtime (Flow itself) and a dynamic ecosystem of pluggable connectors.

Flow is built and versioned using a GitOps workflow. It uses Docker and devcontainers to run on your machine. You’ll work with the command-line interface in VS Code to test locally and to deploy data pipelines in the cloud. Future versions of Flow will include a user interface to run and monitor your pipelines.

### Quick start

**Wondering if Flow is right for you?**

If you're unsure if Flow is the right solution for your data integration needs, you can read about the technical benefits and clear comparisons with similar systems, from an engineering perspective.

{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="overview/comparisons.md" %}
[comparisons.md](overview/comparisons.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

**Want to get up and running ASAP?**&#x20;

Use the **Getting started** documentation to set up your development environment and run through tutorials designed to quickly teach you the most essential skills and concepts.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="getting-started/installation.md" %}
[installation.md](getting-started/installation.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="getting-started/flow-tutorials/" %}
[flow-tutorials](getting-started/flow-tutorials/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

**Looking to understand the concepts behind Flow at a deeper level?**&#x20;

We recommend starting with the tutorials, but after that, read the **Concepts**.

{% content-ref url="concepts/high-level-concepts.md" %}
[high-level-concepts.md](concepts/high-level-concepts.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

**Trying to figure out an advanced workflow?**

If you've mastered the basics but want to refine your pipeline, you'll find answers in our technical **Reference**.

{% content-ref url="reference/flow-reference.md" %}
[flow-reference.md](reference/flow-reference.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
